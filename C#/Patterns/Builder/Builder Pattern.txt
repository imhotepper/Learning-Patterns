The intention is to abstract steps of construction of objects 
so that different implementations of these steps can construct 
different representations of objects.

1. Director
The Director class is responsible for managing the correct sequence of object
 creation. It receives a Concrete Builder as a parameter 
 and executes the necessary operations on it.

2. Abstract Builder
Abstract interface for creating objects (product).

3. Concrete Builders

Construct and assemble parts to build the objects.

4. Product
The final object that will be created by the Director using Builder..
